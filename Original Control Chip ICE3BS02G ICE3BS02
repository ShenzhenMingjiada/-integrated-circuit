Description
The F3 Controller provides Active Burst Mode to reach the lowest Standby Power Requirements <100mW at no load. As the controller is always active during Active Burst 
Mode, there is an immediate response on load jumps without any black out in the SMPS. In Active Burst Mode the ripple of the output voltage can be reduced <1%. 
Furthermore, to increase the robustness and safety of the system, the device enters into Auto Restart Mode in the cases of Overtemperature, VCC Overvoltage, Output 
Open Loop or Overload and VCC Undervoltage. By means of the internal precise peak current limitation, the dimension of the transformer and the secondary diode can 
be lowered which leads to more cost efficiency. An adjustable blanking window prevents the IC from entering Auto Restart Mode or Active Burst Mode unintentionally in 
case of high load jumps.
