• Software compatible with OX16PCI954
• Four 16C950 High performance UART channels
• 8-bit Pass-through Local Bus (PCI Bridge)
• IEEE1284 Compliant SPP/EPP/ECP parallel port (with external transceiver)
• Efficient 32-bit, 33MHz, Multi-function target-only PCI controller, fully compliant to PCI Local Bus specification 3.0, and PCI Power Management Specification 1.1
• PCI and miniPCI Modes (with CLKRUN# and D3cold support in miniPCI modes)
• UARTs fully software compatible with 16C550-type devices.
• UART operation up to 60 MHz via external clock source. Up to 20MHz with the crystal oscillator.
• Baud rates up to 60Mbps in external 1x clock mode and 15Mbps in asynchronous mode.
• 128-byte deep FIFO per transmitter and receiver
• Flexible clock prescaler, from 1 to 31.875
• Automated in-band flow control using programmable Xon/Xoff in both directions Automated out-of-band flow control using CTS#/RTS# and/or DSR#/DTR#
• Arbitrary trigger levels for receiver and transmitter FIFO interrupts and automatic in-band and out-of-band flow control
• Infra-red (IrDA) receiver and transmitter operation
• 9-bit data framing, as well as 5,6,7 and 8 bits
• Detection of bad data in the receiver FIFO
• Global Interrupt Status and readable FIFO levels to facilitate implementation of efficient device drivers.
• Local registers to provide status/control of device functions.
• 12 multi-purpose I/O pins, which can be configured as input interrupt pins or ‘wake-up’.
• Auto-detection of a wide range of optional MicrowireTM compatible EEPROMs, to re-configure device parameters.
• Function access, to pre-configure each function prior to handover to generic device drivers.
• Operation via IO or memory mapping.
• 3.3V operation (5v tolerance on selected I/Os)
• Extended Operating Temp. Range : -40C to 105C
• 160-pin LQFP or 176-pin VBGA package
